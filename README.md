# summernote-bootstrap-grid-plugin
# usage
<code>
var summerNote = $('.summernote-height').summernote({
    toolbar: [
        ['table', ['bootstrap-grid']],
    ]
});
</code>

I made the plugin as small as possible so everyone can understand the functions
- TODO Put the row always at the end
- TODO Choose device
- TODO More column choices

The plugin is in Dutch, change the languagh if you want.
Everone is free to use the code or change it as you wish ;)
